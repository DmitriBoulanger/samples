Customization of ELK-installation
=================================

The ELK-installation includes

- ElasticSearch
- Logstash
- Kibana (ES plug-in)
- Maven (ES plug-in)

Kibana and Maven are parts of the ES-server.
They are installed as the corresponding plug-ins. 

Kibana and Mavel are extended with several application-specific dashboards.
Logstash customization consists of special configuration files and the corresponding
start-up files. ES-customization needs configuration file.

The actual customization is performed as synchonization of the direcrory **ELK**
with actual ELK-installation
