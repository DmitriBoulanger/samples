# Names of sub-directories with performance data (PNG-images).
# Such a directory is expected to contain categorization sub-directories with PNG-images 
# For example, for signature performance:
#
# src/test/resources/de/ityx/contex/omr/houghtransform/data/signature/performance
#
# If new signature-performance data are available, create a new sub-directory as a sibling of the above 
# and use the above as an example for the internal structure. Finally, declare it just below

signature.performanceSubdir=performance/
